# Airbnb Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project conducts **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Airbnb listing data to understand pricing patterns, availability, and the factors that influence rental value. The analysis focuses on data cleaning, visualization, and extracting meaningful insights using Python.

## Objectives
- Explore the distribution of Airbnb prices
- Identify outliers and data quality issues
- Analyze how location and listing features affect price
- Practice real-world data cleaning and visualization techniques

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn
